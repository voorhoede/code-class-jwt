# Code Class JWT

> Node.js app and exercises to learn about JWT

## Usage

Install dependencies and run the app:

```bash
$ npm i
$ node . [port]
```

The app expects an environment variable to be set containing a secret, so that we can sign the JWT:

```bash
$ export JWT_SECRET=<your secret string>
```

Replace `<your secret string>` with your secret string. [Inspiration here](https://randompassphrasegenerator.com/).
